Create Nexus using docker container
To create a Docker container running Nexus 3 and exposing it on port 8081, you can use the following command:

docker run -d --name nexus -p 8081:8081 sonatype/nexus3:latest
This command does the following:

-d: Detaches the container and runs it in the background.
--name nexus: Specifies the name of the container as "nexus".
-p 8081:8081: Maps port 8081 on the host to port 8081 on the container, allowing access to Nexus through port 8081.
sonatype/nexus3:latest: Specifies the Docker image to use for the container, in this case, the latest version of Nexus 3 from the Sonatype repository.
After running this command, Nexus will be accessible on your host machine at http://IP:8081.


Get Nexus initial password
Your provided commands are correct for accessing the Nexus password stored in the container. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

Get Container ID: You need to find out the ID of the Nexus container. You can do this by running:

docker ps
This command lists all running containers along with their IDs, among other information.

Access Container's Bash Shell: Once you have the container ID, you can execute the docker exec command to access the container's bash shell:

docker exec -it <container_ID> /bin/bash
Replace <container_ID> with the actual ID of the Nexus container.

Navigate to Nexus Directory: Inside the container's bash shell, navigate to the directory where Nexus stores its configuration:

cd sonatype-work/nexus3
View Admin Password: Finally, you can view the admin password by displaying the contents of the admin.password file:

cat admin.password
Exit the Container Shell: Once you have retrieved the password, you can exit the container's bash shell:

exit
